CSE Portfolio | AI & ML Track

This repository represents my programming foundation, experiments,
and projects as a Computer Science Engineering student with a focus
on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

The repository is intentionally structured to reflect strong
fundamentals across multiple programming languages, along with
clean code practices and problem-solving skills.

Languages & Focus:
- C        : Core programming, memory concepts, logic building
- Python   : Scripting, automation, problem solving
- Rust     : Modern systems programming, safety and performance

Current Focus:
- Strengthening programming fundamentals
- Writing clean, readable, and structured code
- Building small but meaningful projects
- Preparing a strong foundation before advanced topics (DSA, ML)

Future Roadmap:
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Machine Learning & AI projects
- Internships and industry-level problem solving

This repository is maintained as a long-term technical portfolio
for academic evaluation, internships, and high-impact software roles.


Current Projects:

Python:
- Student Record Manager (CLI)
  - Manages student records using dictionaries and functions

C:
- Array Statistics Program
  - Computes sum, average, min, and max of integer arrays

Rust:
- Simple CLI Greeting Program
  - Demonstrates basic input handling and functions
