# 🦀 Rust Mini Projects

This directory contains **small Rust programs written to explore the language and its safety model**.

The focus is on:
- Ownership and borrowing concepts
- Writing memory-safe code
- Understanding Rust’s strict compile-time guarantees
- Learning modern system programming practices

These projects are minimal by design, prioritizing correctness over complexity.
